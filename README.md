    <h2>Summaries</h2>
      <p><strong>Count Down Timer</strong>: This assignment is what I completed for the creative coding challenge assigned for my               computer science class. It's function was to be a simple timer that counts down from a user inputted value until it reaches zero         when it will stop and display a message. It was able to count down using a set interval that was equivalent to 1000 miliseconds         (1 second). I believe that this will be able to help me continue to program greatly as I now know the basics of programming time         so the possibilities with this are <strong>nearly endless</strong> I believe. Finally it lead me to further understand how to           use multiple things, whatever they may be (lines of code, equations, etc...) to accomplish a specific task, allowing me to               tackle new concepts of most kinds will a little more ease at least.<br><br>
        <strong>Shooting Star</strong>: This project served as an introduction to basic animation with JS by creating and manipulating           shapes over time (moving the stars). If I decide to continute to delve into animation with JS, this project will serve                   as a solid base to start off of as it include the utilazation of most basic concepts for said concept. Finally it will allow me         to continue to learn as it demonstrates how functions (in this case linear ones) can be put to use in the real world, and has           gotten me thinking about other ways to use functions in programming.<br><br>
        <strong>Bouncy Ball</strong>: The bouncy ball challenge, which utilised if statements to change the speed and direction of a             circle at certain points, I completed helped me further understand the use of if statements and creating specific funcions if           they activate (in this case the balls speed and direction would change if an if statement activated). This will allow me to             continue to learn as if statements are integral to programming with js and will open many paths for creativity. Lastly as a             student it has given me a deeper understanding of the importance of steps at certain times as they can be absolutely nessecary           at times.<br><br>
        <strong>Magic 8 Ball</strong>: Just like with the bouncy ball challenge, this project has helped my understanding of using               random numbers and their generators in coding as I created a program that would generate a random number which would cause a             corresponding message to appear inside a magic 8 ball. I can continue to learn with random numbers by thinking of new ways to           use them and how they can be used in conjunction with other functions to create more complex programs. It has also improved my           grasp on the concept of random numbers and how they function.<br><br>
